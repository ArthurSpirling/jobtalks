# Job Talks

This repository contains slides on job talks: (full version)[https://github.com/ArthurSpirling/jobtalks/blob/master/jobtalks2017.pdf] and handout version. Though I generally stand by the advice I give therein, I have become more reticent about sharing this type of information---especially as I move further and further away from the time when I was on the ABD/TT market (well over ten years ago now).  Hopefully you find them helpful.
